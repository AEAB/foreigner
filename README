Foreigner
=========

Rails migrations do not have methods to add foreign keys. Foreigner introduces a few
methods to your migrations for adding and removing foreign key constraints.

Since each adapter implements the API, migrations using Foreigner will continue to
work on databases that do not support foreign keys, such as sqlite.


API
===

An adapter implementing the Foreigner API must implement two methods.
(Options are documented in connection_adapters/abstract/schema_definitions.rb):

  add_foreign_key(from_table, to_table, options)
  remove_foreign_key(from_table, options)

Foreigner also provides extra behavior to 'change_table'. This simply leverages
the implementation of 'add_foreign_key' and 'remove_foreign_key':
  ...
  change_table [table_name] do |t|
    t.foreign_key [to_table], options
    t.remove_foreign_key [to_table], options
  end
  ...


Example
=======

The most common use of foreign keys is to reference a table that a model belongs to.
For example, given the following model:

  class Comment < ActiveRecord::Base
    belongs_to :post
  end
  
  class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_many :comments, :dependent => :delete_all
  end
  
You should add a foreign key in your migration:

  add_foreign_key(:comments, :posts)

The :dependent option can be moved from the has_many definition to the foreign key:

  add_foreign_key(:comments, :posts, :dependent => :delete)

If the column is named article_id instead of post_id, use the :column option:

  add_foreign_key(:comments, :posts, :column => 'article_id')

Foreign keys can be generated using 'create_table' and 'change_table':

  create_table :comments do |t|
    t.foreign_key :posts
  end

  change_table :comments do |t|
    t.foreign_key :posts, :dependent => :delete, :name => 'comments_to_posts'
  end
  
Foreigner should work for those using singular table names. See the rdocs for more details.
